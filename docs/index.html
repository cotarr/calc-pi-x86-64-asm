          Calc-pi is a 64 bit assembly languge program used to calculate &#960; (pi).
          The interface is a simple text based RPN calculator intended
          to run in a Linux command line bash shell.
          It is fully stand alone and has no external library dependencies.

        <p>
          This application was intended for I/O limited to local keyboard and console output
          within a Linux command line shell. This calculation includes a rather ubiquitous
          use of memory pointers that have not been reviewed for safe pointer practices.
          Therefore, modification of the program to service a direct internet connection is not recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
          System memory used for floating point number variables are defined in
          math.asm using RESQ statements to declare unitialized blocks of memory
          in the BSS section. These are statically allocated when the program is
          started as part of the load image. No memory is dynamically allocated.
        </p>
        <p>
          All input and output is performed using assembly language SYSCALL statements.
          All I/O functions are located in the "io_module.asm" file.
          They are used to accept keyboard input, produce console output, read and write
          numbers to disk files, capture program text output to a disk file, and
          read the system clock.
        </p>
        <p>
          Filenames are specified by CLI input.
          The default path is the working directory.
          Filenames are not filtered to restrict path names,
          therefore, can write to any valid path with permission of the user running the program.
          I assume this is not an issue since you can do this independently from the CLI shell.

          I simple terms, it is a set of assembly language floating point math calculations that
          can calculate several numeric constants like pi, e, ln(2) and square root of 2.
          In order to develop these internal functions,
          I wrapped the math capabilties into a very simple text based RNP calculator program.
          This calculator interface provides a very useful way to work with calculations as
          they are written and debugged.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not intended to be a multi-precision library.
          It is not intended to be a programming language.
          All of the internal programs are written in assembler, and there is no high level
          language programming capabilities.
          No validation or testing of the math functions has been perforemed.

          A word about arithmetic.
        </div>
        <p>
          Internal to the program, numbers are stored in binary floating point format using a
          64 bit exponent and an abritrary number of 64 bit words as the mantissa. Numbers
          are normalized by rotating bits until the most significant bit is non-zero.
          Negataive numbers are 2's complement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary backbone calculation is a set of functions for binary floating point bitwise addition, subtraction,
          multiplication and long division. This is a simple straight forward way to
          do arithmetic with low risk of errors. Its easy to write and easy to debug.
          However, it is unfortuantely very slow. It is  literally operating on the numbers bit by bit.
          To speed up the calculation, several shortcuts have been added.
          These include: reducing the accuracy of
          multiplicataion and division when summing an infinite series, suspending normalization
          for intermediate calculations, replacing long division with multiplication of reciprocal,
          and using internal processor MUL command to
          multiply 64 bit registers to a 128 bit result, and DIV to divide 128 bit number
          by 64 bit to get a 64 bit quotient and remainder. The floating point functions are in the source files
          math-add.asm, math-mult.asm and math-div.asm
        </p>
        <p>
          Some calculations, such as e and &#960; do not require floating point format.
          The infinite series can be summed more efficiently when using a fixed point number.
          Time used to perform floating point normalization will be eliminated in this mode.
          In this case, the source file math-fixed.asm contains an alternate set of arithmetic functions
          that can add, subtract, multiply and divide variables in fixed point mode.
          In this format, the mantissa is shifted one word downward so the most significant 64 bit word
          represents the integer part of a fixed point number. The 64 bit integer word can easily hold the integer part of &#960; or e.
          The rest of the mantissa words represent the fraction part which has arbitrary number of 64 bit words.
          Fixed point mode is only used during the intermediate summation of an infinite series.
          Variables are always converted to floating point format at the end of a calculation. Only floating point
          numbers can be printed. There are functions to convert between fixed point and floating point format.
        </p>
        <p>
          Programming of these efficiency tricks was typically developed using the summation of &#931; (1/n!)
          to calculate e. Experiments involving various software edits were put into a spreadsheet for comparrsion.
          The following chart shows a little history of efforts to improve the speed. However, after
          working with these improvements for a while, it seems programming "tricks" to improve speed can often
          cause unexpected errors or artifacts.
